## Introduction

Research share is a plateform that aims at providing free researches ressources and improve the actual
editing process. Click [here](https://github.com/PoCInnovation/ResearchShare/blob/master/doc/Motives.md) if you want to learn more about our motivations and the why.

This project has the "v2" extension because it is the second iteration. You can find
the first version [here](https://github.com/PoCInnovation/ResearchShare)

## Installation

## Quick Start

## Stack

* [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) is used to store the research papers as a mean to decentralize the information.
* [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) & [Solidity]()https://soliditylang.org/ are used as backend. It allows us to run our logic in a resilient & trustless environment. However due to the current state of Ethereum (v2 is underway, huge gas fees, ...) the project may switch to another protocol in the future.
* [Zokrates](https://zokrates.github.io/) is used for [ZKSNARKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof), during the review process.
* [ReactTS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html) is used for the front.
* [TruffleSuite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) is used to tests our contracts.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is used to deploy the platform via [compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

- [x] Very basic front proving components for the features we implemented


### Second Iteration

- [ ] Define a proper way to select Reviewers for a paper & implement it.
